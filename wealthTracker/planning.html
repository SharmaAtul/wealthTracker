	At Indian Ocean Financial services (IFSWA) we invest a lot of time upfront to get to know your current personal and financial situation and lifestyle objectives.</p>
<p>Once we understand your true drivers and your goals, we will commence formulating those and transfer them into workable financial planning strategies, which is detailed in a financial plan.</p>
<h4><strong>Streamlined management of your advice</strong></h4>
<p>At the implementation phase your private adviser will work with you to purchase any investments, set up any business structures and complete any insurance applications.</p>
<p>Your adviser will further keep you up to date on any progress and contact you at completion.</p>
<p>Our online portfolio management platform ensures that you are able to see the progress of your investments and superannuation savings, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, wherever you have internet access. This facility allows you to check your investment performance or provide you and or your accountant access to all the information required to complete your end of the year taxation obligations.</p>
<h4><strong>Unbiased advice</strong></h4>
<p>IFSWA advisers don't receive commission or financial incentives from any product providers, where possible. We charge only a fee for the service we provide. Consequently, you always know how much our advice cost while having the added assurance that all our advice given is developed by the adviser with the true interest of you at heart.</p>
<h4><strong>Ongoing Advice</strong></h4>
<p>A financial plan is a living plan that requires adjusting when your situation changes.</p>
<p>To keep your advice up to date and increase the likelihood that the stated objectives are reached you should review your advice on at least an annual basis.</p>
<h4>Some of those strategies and solutions we offer are:</h4></p>

                <p>Cash flow management and taxation considerations are the cornerstones of a good financial plan.
                Because of its importance we decided to go beyond the required financial planning education level to become qualified taxation advisers.</p>
                <p>The combination of long term strategies combined with cash flow and taxation strategies is a powerful tool that is unique in Geraldton and has saved our clients a considerable amount of money.</p>

                <li>Business entity restructuring</li>

                <p>We have more than 10 years of a healthy experience with (semi) government and private business fringe benefits offerings including the most basic form of salary sacrifice.</p> 
                <p>In general salary packaging is offered by your employer to attract and or maintain employees and include a non-cash benefit.</p>
                <p>In particular if you are working in the medical, government or education sectors there are general a number of offers available that may assist you to increase your after tax benefits from your employer through salary sacrifice.
                However salary packaging is not limited to the (semi) government sectors. Many mining companies offer salary sacrifice benefits and share and option purchase plans that could result in a potential financial benefit for you.</p>
                <p>Examples of salary packaging facilities offered are:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Agree to reduce your before tax wages by adding money to your retirement savings.</li>
                <li>By paying off loans from pre-taxed wages.</li>
                <li>By purchasing shares or options at a discounted market price.</li>

                  <p>We directly invest on behalf of our clients, which means that each client, not the investment manager (usually the trustee) is the legal owner of their investments.</p> 
                </p>The advantage of this approach is to gain more control over your investments while maximising entitlement to any corporate actions.</p>
                </p>What many bank aligned advisers who mainly utilise fund managers wrap accounts and or maters trusts fail tell you is that many of those profitable corporate action opportunities are lost or reduced as only the investment manager (the trustee) and not the actual investor (the beneficiaries) is entitled to the benefits of the corporate action.</p>
                </p>Although some investment managers do provide some flow through arrangements, often any entitlements are reduced as corporate actions are allocated on a legal owner basis.  See example below:</p>
                </p>Woolworths announced a share buyback programme where all legal owners are entitled under the offer to sell 2,000 of their shares back at a price which is 25% above the market price. 
                In the case of the fund manager being the legal owner (Master trust or Wrap account) the fund manager is entitled to sell 2,000 shares. However the fund manager has 20,000 unit holders and when they decide to flow through the benefits to their clients, each client is entitled to sell 0.1 share and not 2,000.
                In the case of the client being the legal owner under our administration platform, client or entity will be entitled to sell all 2,000 shares at a 25% profit!

                <p>99% of all advisers in Australia charge the implementation of insurance either through commission or through commission and fees. 
                This means that for the life of the insurance your adviser get paid money while not providing a service. A nice little income stream.....</p>
                <p>MSFS insurance offering is unique to many of our other competitors and one of the first in Australia. We rebate all commissions back to our clients and only charge an 
                service fee based on the time we spend to implement or review our client's insurance. The result of our charge structure is that:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Your insurance premium is a lot cheaper.</li>
                <li>Over the life of the insurance cover you save heaps of money.</li>
                <li>Our recommendations are not influenced by which insurance company pays the highest commission but who provides the best cover for you.</li>

						<p>Wealth creation is a term used by many amateur "financial advisers" as a way to educate clients that there is really only one major objective in life, which is to have enough savings to be able to live a comfortable retirement.</p>
                        <p> We, at IFSWA have a different approach. Yes, we know that funding your retirement takes effort and long term savings. But what about enjoying your life now!</p> 
                        <p>No one knows what happends tomorrow. You might get a new job offer, move house or your car breaks down. All these unknows should be considered.</p> 
                        <p>At IFSWA we look through wealth creation and dissect it into a number of important areas: assets, income, health,intellectual (thinking), physical development (sports),social appreciation  and most important the right balance of these. </p> 
                        <p>Our strategies focus on creating wealth responsibly for tomorrow while enjoying today. Off-course each client has different views of what current lifestyle and retirement life should look like and therefore each strategy we design is specifically tailored to each client.</p>
                        <p>For example" its no good having lots of money saved for retirement if you dont enjoy your life today or become terminally ill tomorrow.</p>
