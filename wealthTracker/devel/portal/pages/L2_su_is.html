  <h4>What is an SMSF Investment Strategy?</h4>
   <p>An investment strategy is a detailed financial plan made by the trustees of a self-managed super fund based on the sole purpose of the fund. it takes into account the current and future financial needs of each fund member and their risk preferences.  There are particular occasions when trustees may be required to review and update the self-managed super investment strategy.</p>
   <p> Including but not limited to:</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Adding a new member to the fund;</li>
    <li>Death or ill health of a member;</li>
	<li>Pension commencement;</li>
	<li>Risk change</li>
	<li>Specific investment opportunities</li>
	<li>Family split or marriage breakdown</li>
  </ul>
<p> Trustees may also set particular investment objectives for their self managed super fund, and these objectives may change as the trustees become older.</p>
