<h4>Portfolio  Administration</h4>
  <p>Portfolio administration can be divided  into investment administration and portfolio management and includes the  gathering, processing, displaying, and reporting of a client’s portfolio.</p>
  <p>Depending on the level of administration  required these services range from displaying a   simple account balance from one investment or bank account to a full  range of asset classes and 
  securities from a large number of investment and  securities providers. </p>
  <p>Sometimes the service includes an asset  allocation function and a current and proposed scenario function, real time financial news, up to date portfolio access and detailed taxation reporting.</p>
