  <h2><strong>Personal Insurance Advice</strong></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>What is personal insurance?</h4>
   <p>Personal insurance is a protection against the loss of income or capital that would result if the insured passing away, becomes temporary or total and permanent disabled or suffers a trauma event like a stroke.</p>
   <p>There are 4 parties involved with personal insurance:</p>
 
 <ul>
    <li>The owner of the policy, which is the paying entity.</li>
    <li>The life insured, which can be the owner or someone else.</li>
    <li>The beneficiary, which can be the owner, life insured or someone else.</li>
    <li>The insurance company.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A personal insurance pays one or more sums of money to the beneficiaries when an allowable claim has been lodged with the insurance company.</p>
  <p>The most common types of personal insurances are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Life</li>
    <li>Total and Permanent Disability TPD</li>
    <li>Critical Illness, also known as trauma insurance</li>
    <li>Income protection, also known as salary continuance or temporary disablement insurance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personal insurances can be taken out on the life of owner of the insurance, the partner or someone else which makes it an ideal estate and succession planning tool and the owner can be:</p>
     <ul>
    <li>One or more individuals including the life insured</li>
    <li>A partnership, company or trust</li>
    <li>The trustee of the superannuation fund </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Who should take out personal insurance?</strong></h4>
   <p>Any person:</p>
   
     <ul>
    <li>With long term financial commitments including a home or investment loan.</li>
    <li>Who is committed to their long term financial plan and retirement savings.</li>
    <li>That has children or spouses that are financial dependent.</li>
	<li>That operates a (family) business with more than one owner or employee.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
     <h4>When should you review your personal insurances?</strong></h4>
   
    <p>Your life insurance needs change as circumstances in your life change. That's why it's a good idea to re-examine your life insurance needs at least every few years and certainly when big changes, or life events, occur.</p>
<p> Some life events that affecting your insurance needs are:</p>
 <ul>
	 <li>Having a child.</li>
    <li>Getting married.</li>
    <li>Buying a home.</li>
	<li>Changing jobs.</li>
	<li>Taking on debt.</li>
	<li>Supporting aging parents.</li>
	<li>Changes in your business.</li>
	<li>Changes in marital status.</li>

				<h4><strong>What is total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance?</strong></h4>
                <p>TPD offers financial security for the unexpected by providing you with a lump sum if you suffer sickness or injury and are unable to work again in your own occupation or in any occupation.</p>
            <p>Some of the conditions that might be covered by a total and permanent disability insurance plan are:</p>
			
			 <ul>
	 <li>total blindness.</li>
    <li>loss of limbs.</li>
    <li>or any condition that would prevent you from completing everyday tasks (like simply being mobile).</li>
 </ul>
	<p>What conditions are covered can vary significantly from one provider to another, so consider what you might be most at-risk for when comparing total and permanent disability insurance plans carefully.</p>
		<p> 	The difference between TPD and Income protection insurance is that the insured person must be permanent disabled for an insurer to pay out a lump-sum rather than just absent for an extended time of work.</p>
			<h4><strong>Who should take out life insurance?</strong></h4>
			<p>Anyone that requires peace of mind in knowing that the death of the insured person will not result in financial hardship for loved once or other related parties.</p>
			<h4><strong>Who should take out TPD cover?</strong></h4>

				   <p>Put simply, income protection insurance aims to protect your income in the event that you can't work due to illness or injury. Income protection insurance provides an income stream for you should you become unable to work due to an injury or illness. In the event of a claim, the insurer will pay an amount (normally up to 75% of your gross salary in Australia) until you have recovered sufficiently to work again, or up until the maximum benefit period as stated in the policy which is normally 2 year, 5 year or up to age 65.</p>
                   <h4><strong>Why do you need income protection insurance?</strong></h4>
				   <p>Ask yourself what would happen if you woke up tomorrow and found you were incapable of working for an extended period of time. Do you survive without your income for an extended period of time (12 months or longer)?</p>
                    <p>Income protection insurance provides cover for individuals, 24 hours a day, anywhere in the world, regardless of impairment.</p>
                    <p>Each year thousands of people are unable to work due to an accident at work, at home or on the sports field. They may have been signed off work long-term due to illness or mental health problems. There is a very good chance that you actually know of somebody who has been in that situation. What you may not know of was the financial hardship they endured, which for many is the unfortunate reality.</p>
                    <p>Having problems getting to work can be hard, but not being able to work due to something totally out of your control can be devastating.</p>
                    <p>The good news is that you don't need to let an illness or accident break you financially.</p>
                    <p> Income protection insurance is much cheaper than many people think. You can make the right choice for you and your family and affordably insure your most important asset - your body.</p>          
					<p>Finally, you may think Workers Compensation will cover your costs in the case of an accident, but Workers Compensation protects you if your injury is connected with work.</p>
