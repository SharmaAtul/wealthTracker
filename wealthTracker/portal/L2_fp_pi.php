  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Definition:</h4>
   <p>A protection against the loss of income or  capital that would result if the insured passing away, becomes temporary or  total and permanent disabled or suffers a trauma event like a stroke.   The named beneficiary receives the proceeds  and is thereby safeguarded from the financial impact of the insured event.</p>
   <p>There are a number of life insurances available including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Life</li>
    <li>Total and Permanent  Disability</li>
    <li>Trauma or Critical Illness</li>
    <li>Income protection or  Temporary Disablement. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some policies can be taken out through a  clients superannuation fund and each life insured can have different types of  insurance and level of covers.</p>
  <h4>Target:</strong></h4>
   <p>Any person with long term financial  commitments like debts, children, business or commitment to a long term  (retirement) savings plan.

                  <p>Put simply, income protection insurance aims to protect your income in the event that you can’t work due to illness or injury. Income protection insurance provides an income stream for you should you 
                  become unable to work due to an injury or illness. In the event of a claim, the insurer will pay an amount (normally up to 75% of your gross salary in Australia) until you have recovered sufficiently to work again, or up 
                    until the maximum benefit period as stated in the policy which is normally 2 year, 5 year or up to age 65.</p>
                    <p>Target:</p>
                    <p>Any one that is earning an income from earning assessable income </p>
                    <p>Reason:</p>
                    <p>Ask yourself what would happen if you woke up tomorrow and found you were incapable of working for an extended period of time. Do you survive without your income for an extended period of time (12 months or longer)?
                    Income protection insurance provides cover for individuals, 24 hours a day, anywhere in the world, regardless of impairment.</p>
                    <p>If you don’t have savings how could you support your household, repay your mortgage or save for the future? You may think Workers Compensation will cover your costs in the case of an accident, 
                    but Workers Compensation protects you if your injury is connected with work.
