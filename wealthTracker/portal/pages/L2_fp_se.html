  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>What is Succession and Estate Planning?</h4>
   <p>Estate and Succession planning is about taking control. It involves thinking about how you will provide for and protect your family, how you will build and protect your wealth, and how you will share your wealth with the people you care about. Estate planning involves thinking about such issues as how you will continue to look after your family and business if something happened to your spouse; it involves planning how to prepare your children for responsible independence.</p>
<p> All of these issues are relevant throughout your life, not just on your death.  In fact as people live longer, they are increasingly looking to transfer wealth to the next generation during their lifetime, in a structured and planned manner.  Proper consideration of these issues raises a number of commercial, taxation and financial issues.</p>
<p> The key documents associated with personal succession planning are:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The Estate Plan;</li>
    <li>Will;</li>
	<li>Enduring Power of Attorney and a Medical Power of Attorney or Enduring Power of Guardianship.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>However, a number of other documents and strategies may also be appropriate, depending on your particular circumstances. While most people consider their affairs to be relatively simply, the reality today is that a growing number of people have complex affairs.  This is a result of increasing complexity in our laws, including investment, family, bankruptcy, superannuation, pension and taxation laws.  People also want to transfer their wealth in a tailored manner, to suit their personal and family circumstances.</p>

  
  <h4>Who requires succession and estate planning advice?</strong></h4>
  <p>Our government has set up default arrangements  where a person dies without a Will or when the instructions in the Will are not valid or clear. This is called Intestacy.</p>
   <p>These Intestacy rules are complicated and the Administration Act 1903 (WA) sets out rules in relation to the distribution of the estate assets. Now, these default rules do not necessary provide a fair outcome for dependents and do not take into consideration any tax consequences or the impact on the beneficiaries Centrelink entitlements".</p>     
   <p> For this reason estate planning is important for everyone, to ensure that all assets can be efficiently and appropriatly distributed according to the client wishes.</p>
   <p> Alternative reasons for succession planning advice is to ensure that during a family breakdown assets are divided fairly and to ensure a business continues uninterrupted in case a key person exists.</p>

				<h4><strong>What is business succession planning?</strong></h4>
                <p>Business succession planning is the process of preparing to hand over control of the business to others in a way that is the least disruptive to the business’s operations and value. This is the reason why having a formal, written succession plan is so important. However, according to research done by the Australian Federation of Independent Business (AFIB), only 10% of SME owners have a formal, written succession plan, 38% have an informal, unwritten plan and 52% do not have any succession plan at all. With the huge numbers of baby boomers soon retiring, the organization considers this lack of succession planning to be the single biggest issue facing the SME community.
				<p>There are three main succession planning issues to be considered:</p>
				 <ul>
	 <li>Management.</li>
    <li>Ownership.</li>
	<li>Taxes.</li>

	<p>Sooner or later, everyone wants to retire. But if you own a family business, retirement isn't just a matter of deciding not to go into the office any more. Besides ensuring that you have enough money to retire on, the whole question of what happens to the business becomes paramount. Who's going to manage the business when you no longer work the business? How will ownership be transferred? Will your business even carry on or will you sell it?</p>
